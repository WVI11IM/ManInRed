After murdering his wife, Lars Thorwald must dispose of the evidence before the police catch him in the act. This isometric 3D story-driven systemic game is based on Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954) and puts players in the main antagonist's shoes to show his side of the story.

In a time period of 3 in-game days, the player has to chop up the body, find a way to hide or dispose all of the body parts through the map and get rid of all the tools of the crime while managing their stress level and without raising suspicion. All of the player's actions affect the game's pacing, narrative and ending:
- carrying body parts inside a suitcase can increase Thorwald's stress
- leaving traces of blood around the vicinity can alert neighbours
- having a beer, smoking or sleeping in the bed can alleviate stress
- having bloody clothes when talking to the police will get the man arrested
- turning on the radio can reduce stress, but if turned on during midnight, raises suspicion
and so on... the actions and consequences in the narrative are just as extensive.

Contributions:
- Story: Branching narratives and different endings that depend on the player's choices and stats
throughout the gameplay.
- Inventory: Use of Lists for small and big items which can be carried around or dropped.
- Animation implementation: 3D rigged characters with animation transitions between states.
- In-game clock: Day and night cycles with timed events and a directional light that ajusts itself to
the time to imitate the sun's trajectory.
